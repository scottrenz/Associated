# Associated
Associates and deassociates Employee names and Systems names.

Employees may need to be associated with various Systems.
This app is not for adding employee names to the company nor for adding system names to the company.
Those names are assumed to already be there and that another app adds those names.

This app is for associating those names or for deassociating names that were previously associated.
John might be in the Office System.
Mary might be in the Kitchen System.

But now Mary is leaving the Kitchen System.
She is now going to be in the Factory System.

This app shows what System Employees are currently in.
With a click of a button, that Association is removed.

With a click of a button,
you can enter the name of an Employee and the name of a System to which that Employee is to be associated.
